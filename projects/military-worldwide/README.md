## Objective

Analyze the military sizes of countries around the world. See in what regions and by how much they are concentrated.

## Methods

* 'Military Data .xlsx' was obtained at 'https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/military-presence-worldwide'. Its owner acknowledges that they got this dataset from 'https://data.world/stuartltinsley/military-dataset'.
* 'country_list.txt' was obtained at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/countries_of_the_world.htm
* For verification purposes, .pdf files (snapshots) are included in the repository for the above sources

Uses 'Military Data .xlsx' to get quantitative data and uses 'country_list.txt'
to get information of the regions in which countries reside in. Then created and utilized 'country-region_parser.py' to obtain the region corresponding to each country. Applying this python script yielded 'country-region_list.txt' which was then used by my 'military-worldwide.ipynb' notebook to perform my analysis. 'military-worldwide.py' is the python script version of the notebook.
